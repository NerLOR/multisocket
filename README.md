# Lua Multisocket
A library written in C to provide simple IPv4/TCP and IPv6/TCP sockets in Lua. 
The library uses [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) to encrypt connections.
UDP is currently not supported.

## Compatibility
The library is designed to be used in **Lua 5.3**, 
but it could also work with older and newer versions.

#### Features:
* IPv4 TCP connections
* IPv6 TCP connections
* SSL/TLS Encryption on TCP connections

#### Work in progress:
* Bugfixes
* Performance improvements

#### Planned:
* IPv4/IPv6 UDP support
